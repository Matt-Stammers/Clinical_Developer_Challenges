# Clinical Developer Challenges

Every week in the Clinical Developers Facebook Group we try to have a code challenge or competition.

Past challenges are listed above with most of the solutions given. Some of the solutions are missing however, and if you spot one please let us know. 

All the solutions should have a name by them attributing the author of the code. If this is missing, likewise please can you let me know in the group, facebook messenger or via the email list (which can be replied to my personal mailbox).
